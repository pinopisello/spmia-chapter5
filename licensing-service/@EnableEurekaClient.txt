Stesso funzionamento di @EnableDiscoveryClient  come descritto in licensing-service_chapter4/@EnableDiscoveryClient.txt

There are multiple implementations of "Discovery Service" (eureka, consul, zookeeper).
@EnableDiscoveryClient lives in spring-cloud-commons and picks the implementation on the classpath.
@EnableEurekaClient lives in spring-cloud-netflix and only works for eureka. If eureka is on your classpath, they are effectively the same.
